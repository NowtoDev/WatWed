Inside the temple is the Silver Ubosot, which was renovated from the base and boundary of the original Ubosot that was damaged, making this the first Silver Ubosot in Thailand. Inside the Ubosot is the principal Buddha image, Phra Chao Chet Tue, in the Mara-Vijaya attitude. There is also a Lanna-style chapel that has been renovated and combined with contemporary art, while preserving the original features. There are also mural paintings depicting the 12 zodiac signs, images of the pagoda, the center of Chiang Mai in the past, and riddles for tourists to see.

                     <p class="about_text"> <i  style="font-weight: bold;">Wat PhraThat DoiSuthep</i> Located on the top of Doi Suthep, it was built in the early 19th Buddhist century during the reign of King Kue Na Thammarat, the 6th ruler of Chiang Mai, to enshrine the relics of the Lord Buddha that he had invited from Si Satchanalai. Wat Phra That Doi Suthep is considered a second-class royal temple of the Ratchaworawihan type and has been a sacred place of Chiang Mai since ancient times. If anyone visits Chiang Mai and does not go up to pay homage, it is considered as if they have not arrived in Chiang Mai. Wat Phra That Doi Suthep has a seven-headed naga staircase made of cement, approximately 300 steps, or you can use the cable car to go up to pay homage to the chedi. Inside the temple, there is a Chiang Saen-style pagoda with a high base and recessed bell-shaped corners, octagonal, covered with two layers of gold leaf, which was built in the Lanna art style. From the top, you can clearly see the view of Chiang Mai.

It is a first-class royal temple, Wora Maha Wihan type, located in the moat of Chiang Mai, Sam Lan Road, Phra Singh Subdistrict, Mueang District. Wat Phra Singh Worawihan is one of the important temples of Chiang Mai. Inside is Phra Singh or Phra Phuttha Sihing, which is an ancient Buddha image in the ancient Chiang Saen art style, in the Mara-Vijaya posture, sitting cross-legged in the diamond meditation posture. It was built in 700 B.E. and is known as "Chiang Saen Singh Neung". It is also a sacred Buddha image of Chiang Mai and the Lanna Kingdom. Inside Wat Phra Singh Worawihan, there is also Wihan Lai Kham, which enshrines Phra Phuttha Sihing. There are also mural paintings of Suphannahong and Sangthong, which can only be found here. There are also other interesting works of art, such as the ordination hall decorated in the Lanna art style, the library decorated with stucco angels, and a round Lanna-style pagoda. In addition, according to beliefs, the pagoda of Wat Phra Singh is considered the pagoda of the birth year of those born in the year of the dragon (large snake). If you come to pay homage at least once, it will be the most auspicious, giving you a long life and prosperity forever.

                     <p class="about_text"> <i  style="font-weight: bold;">Wat Chedi Luang</i> It is an old royal temple of Chiang Mai, located in the center of the city on Phra Pok Klao Road. It has a spacious area. When you walk in, you will find the Lanna-style royal chapel in the middle. Chao Khun Ubali, the grand master, and Chao Kaew Nawarat built it in 2471. Inside, there is the principal Buddha image, Phra Attharot, in the attitude of presiding over an apology, according to early Chiang Mai art influenced by Pala art (India). In front of the entrance to the chapel, there is a staircase of Naga slithering with their tails intertwined to form the archway of the chapel, which looks very beautiful. This pair of Naga is an ancient work of art that has been around since the beginning and is considered the most beautiful Naga in the North. Wat Chedi Luang Wihan is the place where the largest pagoda in Chiang Mai is enshrined. It was built during the reign of King Saen Mueang Mak, the seventh king of the Mangrai Dynasty. Later, Phraya Tilokarat ordered craftsmen to expand the pagoda to be higher and wider than before and invited the Emerald Buddha to be enshrined for 80 years. Later, in 2088 during the reign of Queen Jiraprapa, an earthquake occurred, causing the top of the pagoda to collapse.

                     <p class="about_text"> <i  style="font-weight: bold;">Wat Phan Tao</i> An ancient temple in the heart of the city, located on Phra Pok Klao Road, Phra Singh Subdistrict, Mueang District. It was originally a sanctuary and a place for casting the Attharos Buddha image of Wat Chedi Luang. Later, it was built as Wat Phan Tao. In the past, Chiang Mai people called this place “Pan Tao” (Thousand Times) temple, which means that if you make merit just once, you will receive merit in return a thousand times. Later, it was distorted to “Phan Tao”. Another reason is probably because this temple was used as a source for building hundreds of kilns to cast Buddha images, so it was called “Wat Phan Tao”. Inside this temple, there is the most beautiful and complete Vihara in Chiang Mai Province. The building is made entirely of teakwood, in the Chiang Saen style. It was originally a Ho Kham or Khum Luang residence of Phra Chao Mahotarades, the 5th ruler of Chiang Mai. During the reign of Phra Chao Inthawichanon (the 7th ruler), he ordered the demolition of this Ho Kham and offered it to be the Vihara of Wat Phan Tao. There is also an ancient-style raised pulpit that is over a hundred years old for visitors to see. Behind the Vihara Ho Kham Luang is the principal chedi of the temple, shaped like a bell on an octagonal base, surrounded by beautiful chedis.

Later, King Kuena built a tunnel for Phra Mahathera Chan to use as a place for meditation. This tunnel has a wall inside with many passageways. Inside the tunnel, there used to be murals, which are assumed to have been painted between 1900-2000 B.E. Originally, the murals covered the entire area of ​​every room. Most of them were pictures of lotus flowers, peonies, and various birds such as peacocks, herons, parrots, and ducks. On top of the tunnel is an old Lanna pagoda. Archaeologists assume that it was built around the beginning of the 20th Buddhist century. It is a bell-shaped pagoda with about 3 round tiers like stacked lotus petals. On top is a spire. In front of the tunnel is a carved stone Buddha head from the Phayao style, 1950-2100 B.E. The temple area is a Buddhist garden, shady with various kinds of trees. It is a forest garden suitable for meditation. Behind is a forest garden and zoo, which is a sanctuary where you can walk around and is another good place for bird watching.
